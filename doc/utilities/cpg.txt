NAME	cpg - C source listing formatter

SYNOPSIS

	cpg [ -b<asename> ] [ -t tabstop ] [ file... ]

DESCRIPTION

cpg is a C language source listing formatter.  It employs certain
triggers to perform its formatting.  Those same triggers may be used to
extract in-line documentation to create documentation.  At the end of
the listing produced by cpg is a table of contents of all files and
functions contained in the current listing.  The table of contents is
sorted alphabetically by function and file.


The listing produced by cpg includes on each line a line number.  On each
line containing any braces ({}), there will also be a
nesting level indicator.  The nesting level indicator includes a number
(the current nesting level) and a directional character.  The
directional characters are:

	> 6	The nesting level increased on this line
	< 6	The nesting level decreased on this line
	* 6	The nesting level changed both ways, with a net change of zero

The triggers that cpg recognizes are itemized below.  Each must appear
in column 1.

<formfeed>

	A formfeed will cause a new page to be started with a full header.

/*F filename *<anything>

	The file name may be specified in a comment preceding a descriptive
	header block.  The filename argument must be delimited by asterisks in
	the trigger.  The filename will appear in all page headings up to the
	next filename trigger or the next file.  A filename comment block
	MUST be terminated by the endofblock trigger (see below).

	This trigger will print as a line in the listing.  This trigger causes
	the start of a new page (form feed) in the listing, with printing of the
	page header including the current file name.

/*H funcname *<anything>

	The function name may be specified in a comment preceding a descriptive
	header block.  The funcname argument must be delimited by asterisks in
	the trigger.  The funcname will appear in all page headings up to the
	next funcname trigger or the next file.  A funcname comment block
	MUST be terminated by the endofblock trigger (see below).

	This trigger will print as a line in the listing.  This trigger causes
	the start of a new page (form feed) in the listing, with printing of the
	page header including the current function name.

/*E*/

	This is the endofblock trigger.  Everything between the last filename or
	funcname trigger and the endofblock trigger will be passed straight
	through by cpg without evaluation of nesting levels, comments, or quoted
	strings.  Thus, a header block is treated as one long comment by cpg.

	This trigger will print as a line in the listing.

/*P*/

	This is a page eject trigger.  It will not print in the listing, but
	will be counted for line numbering purposes.  This trigger causes the
	page heading, title, and subtitle to be reprinted based on their current
	values (see title and subtitle below).

/*S <text> */

	This is the subtitle trigger.  It determines the contents of the second
	title line on the page header.  All characters after the initial space
	and up to but not including the following asterisk (required) are
	included as part of the subtitle.  This trigger will not print in the
	listing but will be counted for line numbering purposes.

/*T <text> */

	This is the title trigger.  It determines the contents of the first
	title line on the page header.  All characters after the initial space
	and up to but not including the following asterisk (required) are
	included as part of the title.  This trigger will not print in the
	listing but will be counted for line numbering purposes.

OPTIONS

-b

	The basename option causes cpg to use only the basename portion of
	the filename (whether obtained from the fileheader trigger or the
	current filename) in page headers as well as the table of contents.
	Thus, if a file is printed using "cpg -bt4 `pwd`/xyz.c", only "xyz.c"
	will show up in the page header.

-t tabstop

	The tabstop argument to the -t option specifies how to expand tabs.  The
	expansion is performed automatically with a tabstop of 8 if none is
	specified.

ARGUMENTS

file

	Any number of file names may be specified on the command line (within
	limits set by whichever shell is used).  Each file will be formatted and
	its name added to the table of contents.  If no file names are
	specified, cpg will read the standard input.

FILES

/tmp/toc_XXXXXX

	temporary file for building the table of contents.

NOTES

	This tool was developed at Benetics Corporation.

	A side note: cpg also properly processes comments in shell scripts and
	makefiles.  These comments are correctly handled when the comment
	character (# or :) is the first nonblank character on a line.  In order
	to facilitate documentation of shell scripts, cpg recognizes the
	sequences #{ and #} as the beginning and ending of nesting, and treats
	them as it does in C program sources.  Thus lengthy for, if, while, and
	case statements may be more clearly documented as to nesting levels,
	particulary in shell scripts.
